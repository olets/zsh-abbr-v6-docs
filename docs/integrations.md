# Integrations

:::warning
These integrations are not regularly tested. It is possible that they are out of date. Pull requests are welcome to fix broken integrations. The zsh-abbr maintainer does not commit to keeping them working â€” if something breaks and the maintainer and the community does not have a fix, it may be removed from this documentation.

## Plugin managers

### zsh4humans

Out of the box, `z4h install` â€”the [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans) plugin management featureâ€” does not support zsh-abbr.

One solution is to use a different installation method. Read [Installation](./installation.md) for possibilities.

Another is to extend `z4h install` with a postinstall hook.

If you can and are willing to use Git in the hook, try this:

```shell
# .zshrc

function z4h-postinstall:replace-with-github-clone() {
  [[ -n $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR && -n $Z4H_PACKAGE_NAME ]] && 'command' -v git 1>/dev/null || return 1

  'command' 'rm' -rf $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR

  'command' 'git' clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/$Z4H_PACKAGE_NAME $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR
}

z4h install olets/zsh-abbr || return
zstyle :z4h:olets/zsh-abbr postinstall z4h-postinstall:replace-with-github-clone || return
```

Otherwise, read [Installation&nbsp;>&nbsp;Manual](./installation.md#manual)'s note on GitHub's REST API. You'll indentify the latest release's associated tag, use that to determine the archive URL to download, and then extract the archive into `Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR`. The following pattern is recommended. (Contributions of a clean solution are welcome.)

```shell
# .zshrc

z4h-postinstall:reinstall() {
  # If called via `zstyle :z4h:<package> postinstall`,
  # will have access to
  # - $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR, the location of the installed package
  # - $Z4H_PACKAGE_NAME, the package argument passed to `z4h install`

  # 1. Delete the `z4h install`-downloaded copy of $Z4H_PACKAGE_NAME
  rm -rf $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR

  # 2. Download a different copy of $Z4H_PACKAGE_NAME to $Z4H_PACKAGE_DIR
  # TODO
}

z4h install <package> || return
zstyle :z4h:<package> postinstall z4h-postinstall:reinstall
```

## Syntax highlighting

### fast-syntax-highlighting

> _By [Teppei Shimaji](https://github.com/shimajiteppei)._

To highlight user abbreviations that will expand, [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting) users can add these lines to `.zshrc` *below* where zsh-abbr and all abbreviations are loaded.

> Known limitations:
> 1. the following fast-syntax-highlighting solution only supports single-word abbreviations. ðŸŒŸ Want highlighting for multi-word abbreviations? Read [zsh-abbr#120](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr/issues/120).
> 1. Only and all of the abbreviations defined when the shell was started will be highlighted. fast-syntax-highlighting won't know about any abbreviation additions, erasures, or renames. To update fast-syntax-highlighting, open a new terminal, or restart the shell by running `exec zsh`.

```shell
# .zshrc

# load zsh-abbr, then

chroma_single_word() {
  (( next_word = 2 | 8192 ))

  local __first_call="$1" __wrd="$2" __start_pos="$3" __end_pos="$4"
  local __style

  (( __first_call )) && { __style=${FAST_THEME_NAME}alias }
  [[ -n "$__style" ]] && (( __start=__start_pos-${#PREBUFFER}, __end=__end_pos-${#PREBUFFER}, __start >= 0 )) && reply+=("$__start $__end ${FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[$__style]}")

  (( this_word = next_word ))
  _start_pos=$_end_pos

  return 0
}

register_single_word_chroma() {
  local word=$1
  if [[ -x $(command -v $word) ]] || [[ -n $FAST_HIGHLIGHT["chroma-$word"] ]]; then
    return 1
  fi

  FAST_HIGHLIGHT+=( "chroma-$word" chroma_single_word )
  return 0
}

if [[ -n $FAST_HIGHLIGHT ]]; then
  for abbr in ${(f)"$(abbr list-abbreviations)"}; do
    if [[ $abbr != *' '* ]]; then
      register_single_word_chroma ${(Q)abbr}
    fi
  done
fi
```

### zsh-syntax-highlighting

> _By [Ihor Urazov](https://github.com/z0rc) and Henry Bley-Vroman._

To highlight user abbreviations that will expand, [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) users can add these lines to `.zshrc` *below* where zsh-abbr is loaded. For more info read the [zsh-syntax-highlighting regexp highlighter documentation](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/docs/highlighters/regexp.md).

Replace `<styles for â€¦>` with a [zsh character highlighting](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Character-Highlighting) string (start at "The available types of highlighting are the following."). For example `fg=blue`, `fg=blue,bg=red,bold`, etc.

> Known limitations:
> 1. The following zsh-syntax-highlighting solutions do not support unmatched parentheses within abbreviations. For example the valid `abbr '('='(x'` will make zsh-syntax-highlighting error. ðŸŒŸ Have a better solution? Please [contribute it](/contributing.html)!
> 1. Only and all of the abbreviations defined when the shell was started will be highlighted. zsh-syntax-highlighting won't know about any abbreviation additions, erasures, or renames. To update zsh-syntax-highlighting, open a new terminal, or restart the shell by running `exec zsh`.

Linux:

```shell
# .zshrc

# load zsh-abbr, then
# make sure to replace `<styles for â€¦>` (read above)

(( ${#ABBR_REGULAR_USER_ABBREVIATIONS} )) && {
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS+=(regexp)
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_REGEXP+=('^[[:blank:][:space:]]*('${(j:|:)${(Qk)ABBR_REGULAR_USER_ABBREVIATIONS}}')$' <styles for regular abbreviations>)
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_REGEXP+=('\<('${(j:|:)${(Qk)ABBR_GLOBAL_USER_ABBREVIATIONS}}')$' <styles for global abbreviations>)
}
```

macOS:

```shell
# .zshrc

# load zsh-abbr, then
# make sure to replace `<styles for â€¦>` (read above)

(( ${#ABBR_REGULAR_USER_ABBREVIATIONS} )) && {
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS+=(regexp)
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_REGEXP=('^[[:blank:][:space:]]*('${(j:|:)${(Qk)ABBR_REGULAR_USER_ABBREVIATIONS}}')$' <styles for regular abbreviations>)
  ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_REGEXP+=('[[:<:]]('${(j:|:)${(Qk)ABBR_GLOBAL_USER_ABBREVIATIONS}}')$' <styles for global abbreviations>)
}
```

After adding the snippets, all new terminals will use them. To use them in an already-open terminal, restart zsh in that terminal:

```shell
exec zsh
```

## vi mode

Switching to vi mode â€”with `bindkey -v` or software which calls `bindkey -v` â€” will wipe out the keybindings zsh-abbr's interactive behavior relies on. If you use vi mode, enable it before initializing zsh-abbr. 

```shell
# .zshrc

bindkey -v
# load zsh-abbr here
```

## macOS System Text Substitutions

> _By [Morten Scheel](https://github.com/mortenscheel) and Henry Bley-Vroman._

Run following snippet in your terminal to create regular user abbreviations for all your macOS text substitutions (to create session and/or global abbreviations, modify the `abbr add` line).

```shell
for substitution in ${(f)"$(defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems | plutil -convert json -o - - | jq -r 'to_entries[] | "\(.value.replace)=\(.value.with)"')"}; do
  abbr add "$substitution"
done
```
